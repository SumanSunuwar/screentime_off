# 20-20-20 Eye Protection App

## Overview
The 20-20-20 Eye Protection App is a desktop application developed using PyQt5, designed to help users reduce eye strain caused by prolonged screen exposure. The app reminds users to take regular breaks by following the 20-20-20 rule, which suggests taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes and focusing on an object 20 feet away.

## Features
- Countdown timer to track screen time.
- Adjustable timer duration (1 to 30 minutes).
- Visual and auditory alerts when it's time for a break.
- Automatic restart of the timer after each break.

## How to Use
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install PyQt5 and PyQt5-tools (`pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools`).
3. Clone the repository or download the source code.
4. Run the application using Python (`python main.py`).
5. Set the desired timer duration using the dropdown menu.
6. Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
7. When the timer reaches zero, an alert sound will play, indicating it's time for a break.
8. Take a 20-second break, then the timer will automatically restart.
